##  What is SPECKit Plus?
**SPECKit Plus** is a structured framework to make software development **simpler and organized**.  
It guides students **step-by-step** from defining an idea to delivering a final working solution.  
The framework has **five core phases**: Constitution, Specify,Plan,Tasks, Implement.

---

## 🔹 1️⃣ Constitution Phase

---

## 🔹 2️⃣ Specify Phase

- Explains **what the system will do and how it should behave**.  
- Ensures all **specifications are understood** before development begins.  

---

## 🔹 3️⃣ Plan Phase 
- Creates a **structured workflow and timeline** for the project.  
- Decides **which features to develop, when, and by whom**.  
- Provides a clear **roadmap** for smooth execution.  

---

## 🔹 4️⃣ Tasks Phase 
- Breaks the project into **small, manageable tasks**.  
- Assigns **clear responsibilities** for each task.  
- Makes the project **organized, trackable, and faster to complete**.  

---
